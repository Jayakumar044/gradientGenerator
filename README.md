In this project, let's build a **Gradient Generator** app

The app must have the following functionalities

Initially, the selected gradient direction should be the first value in the given `gradientDirectionsList`.
The initial values for the HTML input elements with type color should be **#8ae323** and **#014f7b** respectively.
When the values are provided for both the input elements with type color, then provided values should be the text content for the respective paragraph elements.
When the **Generate** button is clicked after selecting the direction and picking the colors, the background of the app should have a linear gradient with the selected direction and colors provided.
